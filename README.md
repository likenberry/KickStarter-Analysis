# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Thousands of kickstarter campaigns are started every year but not all of them will be successful, so in order to create a kickstarter campaign with the best chance of being success, previous kickstarter campaigns were analyzed to see if there were any trends that led to successful campaigns.--- Since there is a lot of information on a lot of different kickstarters the scoop was narrowed to include only kickstarters in the United States as this would be where Louise is looking to start her campaign. By looking at the categories of kickstarters in the US by their outcome, it is clear that there were a lot of successful theater campaigns. ![Graph.Par.Cat.Outcome](path/to/Graph.Par.Cat.Outcome.png). This could be further broken down in the subcategories under the parent categories to see the types of campaigns within the Theater catergory. ![Graph.Sub.Cat.Outcome](path/to/Graph.Sub.Cat.Outcome.png) This shows that the theater category included dramas, plays and musicals with most of the campaigns being plays and about half of them being successful.--- Further analysis of the outcomes of theater campaigns by their start date show that, a lot of successful campaigns were started in the month of May. ![Line.Launch.Ountcome](path/to/Line.Launch.Outcome.png). All of this information incidcates that Louise should start her campaign in the month of May and that the theater category was mostly successful with plays having the most success of the theater category.
