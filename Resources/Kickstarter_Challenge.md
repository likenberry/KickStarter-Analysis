# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is an analysis of over 4000 kickstarter campaigns to see if there are trends that can lead to a successful campaign for Louise. The data for this project are from 4114 kickstarter campaigns between the years of 2009 and 2017. The category of campaigns include everything from film, theater, photography, journalism, food, and more. The kickstarter campaigns were also from multiple countries including, the United States, Great Britain, France, Spain, etc. All of this data can be used to find trends to see when the best time to start a campaign is and what type of campaigns were the most successful. All of the analyses were done using Microsoft Excel.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to narrow down the amount of data in order for a more detailed analysis about the types of campaigns that Louise is looking to start. This included looking at specific countries, categories of campaigns, launch dates, years, goals and pledged amounts, and if the campaign was a success amonge others. Since not everyone has the ability to read large amounts of data and comprehend what the data is trying to say, the purpose of this project was to create a clear analysis using visualizations and simplified examples to show what factors make a successful kickstarter campaign for Louise.

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis was started by exploring the data to see the types of variables that it contained including how the data was formatted. One of the first challenges with this data set was that all of the dates were in a format created with the Unix Epoch Clock, which is the number of seconds that has elapsed since January 1, 1970. Luckily Excel has a function to convert the Unix Time into a more readable format. This was done by dividing by the number of seconds in a minute, number of minutes in an hour and finally the number of hours in a day and adding the date of 1970, 1, 1. Two new columns were created to hold this newly readable data, they were titled "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion". Another way to make data more readable is to add conditional formatting, this was done to the outcomes column to see at a glance which campaigns were successful, failed or canceled. Conditional formatting was applied so that successful campaigns were colored green, canceled campaigns were colored yellow, live campaigns were colored blue and failed campaigns were colored red. Here is a an example for Success and Canceled Outcomes. ![Example of Conditional Colors of Outcome](</https://github.com/likenberry/KickStarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Color_Based_on_Outcome.png) Another column was created hold data about the percentage of funded campaigns to see how what percentage of campaigns reached their goal funding. Full funding and over was given a color value and under full funding was given a red color value on a color scale basis. While examining this results it became clear that there was an issue with this process. All of the values appeared to be the same color. This indicated that there was probably an outlier value that was skewing all of the data so that an accurate picture of the percentage funded column was not possible. This challenge was overcome by changing the rules of the conditional formatting to adjust to maximum type of percentile and manually entering a value of 90 to exclude that outlier which physically removing the data it represents. Here is an example of the how the shade of the color shifts based off of the percentage funded. ![Example of Conditional Colors Based on Values](</https://github.com/likenberry/KickStarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Color_Based_on_Value.png>) Another challenge was encountered while trying to create an average donation column. This column was created and the formula used was the ROUND function and allowing two decimal points. The challenge arose since not all of the campaigns had backers meaning that there was no money to divide by for the ROUND formula which meant that there was an error whenever the formula tried to divide by zero. This was fixed by using the IFERROR function. This function was nested within the ROUND function so that it looked like: =IFERROR(ROUND(Value/Value),0). This put a value of zero wherever the error had appeared in the column. In order to really look at the categories of campaign types, the column of Category and Subcategory had to be manipulated in separate the Category and the Subcategory into two new separate columns using the "Convert Text to Columns Wizard" and indicating that the category and subcategory were separated by a "/". By doing this pivot tables can be created to visualize the data by Parent Category and Subcategory separately. Since Louise is interested in creating a theater campaign, this can now be filtered for when created a pivot table and all of the subcategories within the Theater parent category can be investiaged if necessary. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
One thing that might be important when starting a kickstarter campaign is when to start the campaign, since the start and end date of the campaign could impact the outcome. To see if there was a trend with the start date of the kickstarter campaigns, a pivot table was created where the outcome of all theater campaigns could be visualized by what month they were started or their launch date. This was done by inserting a pivot table, adding "Parent Category" and "Year" to the Filters section, adding "Date Created Conversion" to the Rows section, "outcomes" to the Columns section and finally "outcomes" to the Values section. The "Parent Category" was filtered to only show Theater campaigns and the "outcomes" was filtered to remove "live" as an outcome. A pivot chart was then inserted with the style selected as line chart so that the results of the pivot table could be visualized.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another aspect that could make a difference in a successful campaign is the amount of money that the kickstarter is asking for or the goal for that kickstarter campaign. Asking for too much money might mean that your campaign is unsuccessful because it does not reach its funding goal but not asking for enough means you might not be able to do whatever project your campaign is for. In order to make this data a little more managable, categories of goals were grouped together into $5000 ranges. The VLOOKUP Function was used to retrive the appropiate data for the number of Successful, Canceled and Failed campaigns for each goal range. This function was also filtered by the subcategory "plays" so that only results within the goal range, including the specific outcome and play subcategory were included. A percentage of each outcome was calculated from the total number of campaigns in each goal range so that a visualization could be created to see any trends from this data. A line chart was inserted with the percentage amounts from each category selected. 
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
This is by no means a complete analysis of all of the available data but it does paint a clearer picture of some trends that could create the circumstances for a successful campaign for Louise. Among some of the challenges address previously, using the VLOOKUP function was challenging to make sure that the right data was being retrived for each goal range and editting the formula for each goal range. 

## Results
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](</https://gitbhub.com/likenberry/KickStarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png>)
From the analysis and visualization of the outcome based on the launch date of kickstarter theater campaigns, some conclusions can be made such a majority of the campaigns were started in May and this was also the month when the campaigns that were successful were started. The recomendation for Louise is to start her theater campaign in the month of May.

### Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes Based on Goals](</https://github.com/likenberry/KickStarter-Anlysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png>)
From this visualization, it is possible to see that there is a lot of fluctuation in the outcome of a campaign based on the goal. The campaigns that had a goal of less than a thousand dollars had the best chance of meeting their goal but that is sort of unrealistic for most campaigns. Campaigns with a goal of between 35000 and 49999 dollars had an almost 70% chance of meeting their goals and this was within the range that Louise was thinking of the goal for her kickstarter. 
### Limitations of Data Set
Some of the limitations of this dataset is that this data is four years old but it does show general trends that could still be consistent if the data was up to date. Some outliers were discovered while exploring this dataset and they were not removed but removing those outliers could give more accurate trends. Another limitation of this dataset is that there was no detailed statistical analysis so there is no way to definetly say if the noticed trends were statistically significant. Another limitation of this data set is that there is no way to know for sure the accuracy of this data. There is always the chance of errors during data collection and data entry and since this data was collected directly there is no way to know if there are errors without a significant amount of research and time. 
### Potential Other Analyses
It might be helpful to create a visualization of the length of campaigns based on their outcomes to see if how long a campaign lasted impacted the outcome of the campaign. This would help Louise determine how long to run her campaign since she now knows when to start said campaign. Louise also showed interest in maybe starting a campaign in Great Britain so the above analysis could be adjusted to see results from Great Britain instead of the United States. It might also be helpful to run actual statistics on some of the data to see if trends were significant or not for future research. There could also be a trend with what year a campaign was started, by looking at the outcome of a campaign based on the year, more analysis of what made those years successful or not would require more data than the data analyzed here but that would add another factor to consider when creating a kickstarter campaign.
